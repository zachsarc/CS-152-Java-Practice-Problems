In the quiet scrapyard of Sector 9, an old robot named Rusty woke up from a 300-year slumber. His circuits buzzed weakly, and one eye flickered on. Above him, the stars twinkled—and among them, a red beacon pulsed from the Moon.

Rusty remembered his last command: “Fix the Moon Wrench.”

The Moon Wrench was a giant mechanical arm designed to keep Earth’s tides in balance. Without it, chaos would erupt across the planet. Rusty creaked to his feet, gathered some leftover solar panels, and began his long journey.

He hitched a ride on a passing cargo drone, sweet-talking it with ancient binary jokes. Upon landing, he found the Moon Wrench twisted and tangled. With just a screwdriver made from melted spoons and a single line of legacy code, Rusty rewrote the command protocol and realigned the gears.

The wrench groaned. Then it spun.

Earth's tides calmed.

Rusty, having completed his mission, lay down beside the wrench, smiled (as much as a rusted robot could), and powered down once again—waiting for the next time he was needed.
